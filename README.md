## EPEM ESP32 ATM90E32 ATM90E36 Ethernet Power Energy Monitor SDK

This is a new project.

![enter image description here](https://github.com/DitroniX/EPEM-Ethernet-Power-Energy-Monitor/blob/main/Datasheets%20and%20Information/EPEM%20-%20Ethernet%20Power%20Energy%20Monitor%20%28Placeholder%29.jpg?raw=true)

**Based on IPEC and other project commitements and feedback, this is a NEW project which will now evolve during Q3 2023.**

EPEM follows in the successful development footsteps of the IPEM and IPEC Power Energy Monitoring Boards.

EPEM is an Ethernet Power Energy Monitor and Controller. 3 Phase, or 3 x Single Phases, with DAC/PWM/MPWM/MPPT/I2C Expansion Port Outputs.

This is very much in development and work in progress (July 2023)

Please feel free to email me with any wish list ideas..
