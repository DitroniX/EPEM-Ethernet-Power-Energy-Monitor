**Based on IPEC and other project commitements and feedback, this is a NEW project which will now evolve during Q3 2023.**

EPEM follows in the successful development footsteps of the IPEM and IPEC Power Energy Monitoring Boards.

EPEM is an Ethernet Power Energy Monitor and Controller. 3 Phase, or 3 x Single Phases, with DAC/PWM/MPWM/MPPT/I2C Expansion Port Outputs.

 - For remote Solar Power Energy installations which have no/limited WiFi coverage
 - EPEM is an Ethernet based Power Energy Monitor and  - Controller.
 - ATM90E32 Enhanced High-performance Energy Metering  - Device.
 - Espressif ESP32 (Popular and Reliable MCU).
 - Full Three Phase Remote Power Monitoring (3P3W, Y or Î”).
 - Up-to 3 x Single, Split, Individual Phase Power Monitoring.
 - DAC, PWM, MPWM, MPPT and I2C Expansion Ports.
 - Automated Controlling of Solar Power Diversion, Smart Charging, Relays etc.
 - Stand-Alone Operation, and/or IoT MQTT Integrated.

**Update 15th August 2023**

This board is in the design stages:

Following a couple of weeks technical pondering, I now have a ballpark for the EPEM board design outline and the proof of concept and design is now underway.

Below is an overview (in no particular sort order), of some of the many areas being covered in this board R&D, all of which reflect in the design, prototyping, build and manufacturing costs.

-   ATM90E32 and/or ATM90E36
    
-   ESP32 Variant
    
-   Backup WiFi/BT, or Not.
    
-   IPEM/IPEC Design Continuity
    
-   Ethernet Controller PHY SPI Interface and Protocols
    
-   Wake Up over UDP
    
-   Voltage and Noise Tolerance
    
-   PoE Standard(s) and Compliance to 802.3at Type 1 (802.3af)
    
-   PoE Galvanic Isolation and Safety
    
-   PoE Voltage Range
    
-   Power Device (PD), Controller
    
-   Power Demands and Management
    
-   Thermal Protection and Shutdown/Reset
    
-   PoE Operating Distance (Power and Data) >= 100M?
    
-   Lightning Surge Protection
    
-   ESD Protection
    
-   Transient Voltage Suppression
    
-   On-Board Power DC-DC
    
-   Target EMC Compliance (Ideally the more stringent Class B)
    
-   Target EMI Compliance (Ideally 4kV C, 8kV A, 10 V/m RFI)
    
-   Component Density v Power/Temperature
    
-   Operating Temperature Range
    
-   Temperature Sensing
    
-   Low Voltage Reset and Brown Out (BOR)
    
-   Board Size, Layers, Stack etc.
    
-   Testability and Test Points
    
-   Flying Probe Testing
    
-   Cost, Manufacturability and Line Testing
    
-   Continuity of IPEM/IPEC Code Base
    
-   IPEC Expansion Port Compliance
    

Now the above 'shopping' list is broadly complete, the design can move forward.

Should you have any thoughts, or have a challenging application and would like to beta test a board, please let me know.
