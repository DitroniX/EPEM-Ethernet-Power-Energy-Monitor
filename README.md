**Based on IPEC and other project commitements and feedback, this is a NEW project which will now evolve during Q3 2023.**

EPEM follows in the successful development footsteps of the IPEM and IPEC Power Energy Monitoring Boards.

EPEM is an Ethernet Power Energy Monitor and Controller. 3 Phase, or 3 x Single Phases, with DAC/PWM/MPWM/MPPT/I2C Expansion Port Outputs.

 - For remote Solar Power Energy installations which have no/limited WiFi coverage
 - EPEM is an Ethernet based Power Energy Monitor and  - Controller.
 - ATM90E32 Enhanced High-performance Energy Metering  - Device.
 - Espressif ESP32 (Popular and Reliable MCU).
 - Full Three Phase Remote Power Monitoring (3P3W, Y or Î”).
 - Up-to 3 x Single, Split, Individual Phase Power Monitoring.
 - DAC, PWM, MPWM, MPPT and I2C Expansion Ports.
 - Automated Controlling of Solar Power Diversion, Smart Charging, Relays etc.
 - Stand-Alone Operation, and/or IoT MQTT Integrated.

This is in the design stages:  What would you like see on this?
